You must be using Borland C++ v5.0 - I can't garauntee it will compile on any other windows compiler.

I have tested this under Borland C++ v4.5 and v5.0, load the
file into the IDE and select WIN32 Console app, static libraries and turn
off all compiler warnings.  This should work in the same way for the Microsoft
compiler but I haven't tested it.  You should make sure the platform.h file
is set for a Windows compile.
