HISTORICAL/OldDocumentation/* The old texts were getting so coulded that by the time you got to what you really wanted, you were too bored to continue reading.


NOTE: The HISTORICAL directory is where we're sticking all the stuff that's required by the old original codebase.  Hopefully, you'll not need to consult that stuff - since this will be completely re-vamped.
